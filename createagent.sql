The PatientEncounter is unstructred Cortex Search captures unstructured clinical documentation, such as encounter summaries, provider notes, and other rich narrative text extracted from source documents.
The agent first uses identifiers (such as MRN or account number) to join and validate relationships between patients and their encounter records. Encounter data is regularly ingested and processed to extract key fields (e.g., Encounter ID, Account Number, MRN), ensuring unstructured notes can be surfaced, searched, and summarized alongside the parent patientâ€™s structured information."
